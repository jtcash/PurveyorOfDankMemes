## Purveyor of Dank Memes
A project by Jeffrey Cash

### Description

In this project, I will be expanding upon the first-person camera controls and mouse interaction I have already implemented, as well as expanding on my dynamic bezier curve implentation to make surfaces constructed of bezier batches. Beyond this, I am not certain what I am going to implement, but I expect I'll be implementing either a procedurally modeled city or procedurally modeled plant. My goal is to have something that can be explored interactively with first-person mouse and keyboard controls.

### Technical Features

- First-person camera controls: Already partially implemented
- Selection buffer for selection with mouse: I already have a different system for mouse selection used to control the bezier curve points in the previous assignment, but I will migrate this to use a selection buffer.
- Bezier Patch surfaces: I already have a good and abstracted bezier curve implementation, so extending it to 2-dimensions should not be too much work.
- Procedurally generated buildings: This is not necessarily what I'll end up implementing. The important thing to me is to have something worth exploring with first-person controls.



### Creative Efforts

I am thinking that most of my effort will go into a procedural modeling system to generate some interesting structures. Without something interesting to explore, there is not much of a point for smooth mouse-and-keyboard controls.
